# LingoNet

## About The Project

As avid language learners, we have noticed that it is difficult to find language partners to practice with, especially due to the pandemic. As a result, we have decided to create an application, LingoNet, that will allow language learners to find other language learners who speak or also want to practice the same target languages. The app opens with the login/signup page. There will be a user feed where they can view other learners’ profiles and send friend requests. There will be a user profile page where users can edit their profiles and add/edit/delete an introductory post. There will be a friends page where users can view pending, incoming, and accepted friend requests. Users can view their friends’ profiles and contact information.
